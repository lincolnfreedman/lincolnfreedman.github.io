## About Me

I'm an indie game developer from San Francisco California, currently pursuing an MS in Game Science & Design at Northeastern University.

I have almost 10 years of experience programming. I am also an avid creative writer and lover of art. My BA is in Film & Media Studies.

Most of my game dev experience is in Unity. However, I also know Python, Java, Javascript and am learning to work with Unreal in C++.

I especially love strategy games, and have spent far too much time playing Pokemon, StarCraft 2, DOTA 2, EUIV, Path of Exile, etc.

My design interests are especially focused on the interactions between procedural generation and resource management, but I am open to working on any type of game!
