## About Me

I'm an indie game developer from San Francisco California, currently pursuing an MS in Game Science & Design at Northeastern University.

Most of my game dev experience is in Unity. However, I also know Python, Java, JS, Lua, and am learning to work with Unreal in C++.

I have a background in robot code and really love tackling complex technical problems at multiple levels. I am also a very creative person and a lover of art. My BA is in Film & Media Studies.

I especially love strategy games, and have spent far too much time playing Pokemon, StarCraft 2, DOTA 2, EUIV, Path of Exile, etc.

My design interests are most focused on the interactions between procedural generation and resource management, but I love playing and working on almost all genres of games!
