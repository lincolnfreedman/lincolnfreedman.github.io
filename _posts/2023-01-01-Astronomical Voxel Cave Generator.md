lead_text: 'This project uses the Unity Engine to procedurally generate a voxel (3d pixel) cave system environment. It also fetches real time distances between Earth and other planets in the Solar System with AstronomyAPI. The distances are then used as inputs to influence various aspects of the procedural generation algorithm, such as number of cavities and tunnels, geometric irregularity, and visual effects used.'
