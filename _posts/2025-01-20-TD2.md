lead_text: "A narrative exploration game made for a course on environmentalism in video games at UC Santa Barbara. Dialogue choices effect the journal entries gathered by the player, as well as the ending. The underlying theme of the game is that frightening natural phenomena which we do not understand may only be frightening because of the ways we approach them."
